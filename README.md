Service2
Exercise 2:
Create a remote service. The application opens a window with two buttons. Clicking on the top button will change the background color of the window, clicking on the bottom button sends a message (the current date and time) to a remote service, which after 5 seconds will show a Toast with the message. The meaning with the 5-seconds delay and color change button is that you should find that the service does not block the application as it is performed in another process than the application.
